"Look, Mia, I found a nice shell!" he said.

Mia looked at the shell and frowned. She recognized it. It was the same shell that she had found yesterday and left on her towel. She thought Tom had taken it from her.

"That is my shell, Tom!" she said. "You took it from me!"

Tom was confused and sad. He did not take the shell from Mia. He found it in the sand. He did not want to make Mia angry.

"No, Mia, I did not take your shell. I found it here. See, there are more shells like it." he said and pointed to the sand.

Mia did not believe him. She thought he was lying. She wanted her shell back. She tried to grab it from Tom's hand.

"Give me my shell, Tom! It is mine!" she said.

Tom did not want to give up his shell. He liked it too much. He held it tight and pulled it away from Mia.

"No, Mia, it is my shell! I found it first!" he said.

They both pulled and tugged on the shell. They were both angry and loud. They did not hear their mom calling them.

"Tom! Mia! Come here, please!" their mom said.

She saw them fighting over the shell. She was not happy. She walked over to them and took the shell from their hands.

"Stop it, both of you! What is going on?" she said.

Tom and Mia both tried to explain. They both said the shell was theirs. They both said the other one was wrong.

Their mom looked at the shell. She recognized it too. She had seen it before. She knew who it belonged to.

"Tom, Mia, this shell is not yours. It is not mine. It is not anyone's. It is a shell that belongs to the sea. It is a gift that the sea gives us to enjoy, but not to keep. Do you understand?" she said.

Tom and Mia looked at the shell. They looked at their mom. They looked at each other. They felt sorry for fighting. They nodded.

"Yes, mom, we understand." they said.

Their mom smiled and hugged them. She gave them the shell to hold together.

"Good. Now, why don't you share this nice shell and look for more shells to admire? But remember, when we leave the beach, we have to leave the shells behind. They are not ours to take. They are the sea's to give." she said.

Tom and Mia agreed. They thanked their mom and said sorry to each other. They held the shell and looked at its colors. They felt happy and peaceful. They went back to playing on the beach. They found more shells and made piles of them. They shared them and admired them. They did not fight over them. They had fun.

"Let's race!" Ben said. "I bet I can go faster than you!"

"OK!" Mia said. "But be careful. There is a cable at the bottom of the hill. It is for the lights. We have to stop before we hit it."

They got ready and started to pedal. They went down the hill very fast. They felt the wind in their hair and the sun on their faces. They laughed and shouted.

But Ben did not listen to Mia. He wanted to win. He did not look at the cable. He did not stop. He hit the cable with his bike. He fell off and hurt his leg. He started to scream.

Mia stopped and ran to him. She saw the blood on his leg. She felt sorry for him. She said, "Ben, why did you not stop? I told you about the cable. You were not wise. You were silly. Now you are hurt."

Ben cried and said, "I'm sorry, Mia. I wanted to win. I did not think. You were wise. You were careful. Can you help me?"

Mia nodded and said, "Yes, I can help you. But first, we have to call Mom. She will know what to do. She will take you to the doctor. He will make your leg better."

She took out her phone and called Mom. She told her what happened. Mom said she would come right away. She told them to stay where they were and not to move.

Tom was a cat who liked to play outside. He ran, jumped and chased birds and mice. He did not like to take baths or brush his fur. He thought he looked fine with his dirty, tangled coat.

One day, it was very cold and windy. Tom wanted to find a warm place to sleep. He saw a big house with a nice garden. He sneaked in through a hole in the fence. He saw a dog house with a soft blanket inside. He thought it was perfect for him.

He crawled into the dog house and curled up on the blanket. He felt cozy and happy. He did not know that the dog house belonged to Rex, a big, friendly dog who lived in the house.

Soon, Rex came back from his walk with his owner. He smelled a strange scent in his dog house. He barked and ran to see who was there. He saw Tom, the dirty cat, sleeping on his blanket. He was angry and scared.

"Who are you? Get out of my house!" Rex growled.

Tom woke up and saw Rex. He was terrified. He hissed and scratched Rex's nose. He tried to run away, but Rex blocked his way.

"Leave me alone! I just wanted to be warm!" Tom cried.

Rex and Tom fought and made a lot of noise. Their owner heard them and came to see what was wrong. He saw Rex and Tom, both hurt and scared. He picked up Tom and took him inside. He cleaned his wounds and gave him some food and water. He also gave him a bath and brushed his fur. He made him look clean and shiny.

He also checked on Rex and gave him a treat and a hug. He told him he was a good boy for protecting his house. He also told him he was sorry for the cat who was lost and cold.

He put Tom in a cage and called the animal shelter. He hoped they would find a good home for him. He felt sorry for him, but he knew he could not keep him. He already had Rex, who was his best friend.

Tom felt warm and full, but also sad and lonely. He wished he had a friend like Rex. He wished he had taken better care of himself. He realized he had been selfish and rude. He shivered in his cage and licked his paw. He hoped someone would love him and teach him how to be a good cat. He learned a hard lesson that day. He learned that being dirty and mean was not fun or smart. He learned that being clean and kind was better for him and others.

"Look, Ben, that cloud looks like a bunny!" Anna said, pointing at the sky.

"I see it, Anna, it has long ears and a fluffy tail!" Ben said, smiling.

They looked for more clouds that looked like things they knew. They recognized a car, a flower and a star. They were having fun.

Then they saw a big cloud that looked like nothing. It was just a big, white, fluffy cloud. It covered the sun and made the sky darker.

"What is that cloud, Anna?" Ben asked, feeling scared.

"I don't know, Ben, it is a strange cloud. Maybe it is a monster cloud!" Anna said, feeling scared too.

They hugged each other and wished the cloud would go away. They did not like the strange cloud.

But then the wind blew and the cloud moved. The sun came out again and made the sky bright and blue. The strange cloud was gone.

"Look, Ben, the sky is beautiful again!" Anna said, feeling happy.

"Yes, Anna, it is. And look, there is a rainbow!" Ben said, feeling happy too.

Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to observe the bugs and the flowers. They saw a big mushroom under a tree. It was brown and round and had spots on it.

"Look, a mushroom!" Lily said. "Can we touch it?"

"I don't know," Ben said. "Maybe it is not good to touch. Mom said some mushrooms are bad."

Lily wanted to touch it anyway. She reached out her hand and poked the mushroom. It felt soft and wet. But then the mushroom broke and fell apart. Lily gasped.

"Oh no!" Ben said. "You broke the mushroom! What if it was someone's home? What if a bug lived there?"

Lily felt sorry. She did not mean to break the mushroom. She did not know it was so fragile. She looked at the pieces of the mushroom on the ground. She saw a small worm crawling out of one of them. She felt even more sorry.

"I'm sorry, worm," she said. "I'm sorry, mushroom. I did not want to hurt you. I was just curious."

Ben saw that Lily was sorry. He hugged her and said, "It's okay, Lily. You did not know. Maybe we can find another mushroom for the worm. Maybe we can help it find a new home."

Lily nodded. She wiped her tears and smiled. She and Ben looked around the garden for another mushroom. They found one that was smaller and white and had no spots. They carefully picked it up and brought it to the worm. They placed it near the broken mushroom and hoped the worm would like it.

"Here you go, worm," Lily said. "This is a new mushroom for you. We hope you are happy. We are sorry for breaking your old mushroom."

The worm wiggled and seemed to say thank you. Lily and Ben felt happy. They learned to be more careful with the things they observe. They also learned to say sorry when they make a mistake. They went back to playing in the garden, but they did not touch any more mushrooms. They just looked at them and admired their colors and shapes.

Lily and Ben liked to play pirates in the garden. They had a big box that was their ship, and a stick that was their sword. They also had a hook that they found in the shed. It was shiny and sharp, and they pretended it was a treasure.

One day, they decided to go on an adventure to find more treasure. They put on their hats and scarves, and took their ship, sword and hook with them. They walked around the garden, looking for clues. They saw a bird, a flower, a rock, but no treasure.

Then, they saw something shiny under a bush. They ran towards it, hoping it was gold or jewels. But when they got closer, they saw it was a frozen pond. It was very cold and slippery, and they could see fish and plants under the ice.

"Wow, look at that!" Lily said. "Maybe there is treasure under the ice!"

"Let's find out!" Ben said. He took the hook and tried to break the ice with it. He hit the ice hard, but it did not crack. He hit it again, and again, but nothing happened.

"Be careful, Ben!" Lily said. "You might fall in!"

Ben did not listen. He wanted to find the treasure. He hit the ice harder and harder, until he made a small hole. He looked inside, and saw something shiny. He reached for it with his hook, but he lost his balance. He slipped and fell into the pond.

Lily screamed. She saw Ben go under the water. She was very scared. She did not know what to do. She wanted to help Ben, but she did not want to fall in too. She looked around, and saw a big stick. She grabbed it, and ran to the pond. She lay down on the ice, and reached for Ben with the stick.

"Ben, Ben, grab the stick!" she shouted. "I'll pull you out!"

Ben heard Lily's voice. He was very cold and wet. He saw the stick, and grabbed it. Lily pulled him out of the pond. He was shivering and coughing. He dropped the hook, and hugged Lily.

"Thank you, Lily!" he said. "You saved me!"

"I'm sorry, Ben!" Lily said. "I should have been more polite. I should have let you have the hook. It was your treasure."

Ben shook his head. He smiled at Lily. He said, "No, Lily, you are my treasure. The hook was just a hook. It was not worth it. You are my best friend."

They hugged each other, and walked back to their ship. They decided to play pirates another day, when it was warmer and safer. They learned their lesson. They learned to be careful, and to share, and to be polite. They were happy.

Lily and Ben went to the park with Mom. They saw a big pond with many ducks and swans. Lily liked the swans. They were white and graceful. She wanted to feed them some bread.

"Mom, can I give some bread to the swans?" Lily asked.

"Sure, but be careful. Don't go too close to the water. And don't throw the bread too hard. The swans might get scared," Mom said.

Lily nodded and took a piece of bread from Mom. She walked slowly to the edge of the pond. She saw a swan swimming near her. She smiled and tossed the bread gently to the swan. The swan caught the bread and ate it. It looked happy.

"Thank you, swan!" Lily said.

The swan nodded and swam away. Lily looked for another swan to feed. She saw one that was hidden behind some reeds. It was smaller than the other swans. It looked shy.

"Hello, swan! Do you want some bread?" Lily called.

The hidden swan peeked out from the reeds. It saw Lily and the bread. It wanted the bread, but it was afraid of Lily. It stayed behind the reeds.

"Come on, swan! Don't be scared. I won't hurt you. I just want to be your friend," Lily said.

She threw the bread closer to the hidden swan. The hidden swan saw the bread. It was hungry. It decided to try the bread. It swam out from the reeds and took the bread. It tasted good.

"Thank you, Lily!" The hidden swan said.

Lily was surprised. She didn't know that swans could talk.

"You're welcome, swan! What's your name?" Lily asked.

"My name is End. I'm the last of my family. The other swans left me because I'm different. I can talk, but they can't," End said.

"That's sad, End. But you're not alone. You have me. I'm your friend. And you're not different. You're special," Lily said.

End smiled. He felt happy. He had a friend.

"Thank you, Lily. You're special too. Can I stay with you?" End asked.

"Of course, End. You can stay with me. Come on, let's go to Mom. She'll like you too," Lily said.

She took End's wing and led him to Mom. Ben saw them and was amazed.

"Wow, Lily! You have a talking swan!" Ben said.

"Yes, Ben. This is End. He's my friend. Can he play with us?" Lily said.

"Sure, Lily. He can play with us. Hi, End. I'm Ben. Nice to meet you," Ben said.

"Hi, Ben. Nice to meet you too. You're Lily's brother, right?" End said.

"Yes, I am. You're very smart, End," Ben said.

"Thank you, Ben. You're very kind, Ben," End said.

Mom saw them and was shocked.

"Lily, Ben, what's going on? Who's this swan?" Mom asked.

"Mom, this is End. He's a talking swan. He's my friend. Can he stay with us?" Lily said.

"A talking swan? That's incredible. How did you find him?" Mom asked.

"He was hidden behind some reeds. He was lonely. I gave him some bread. He thanked me. He told me his name. He asked me to be his friend. I said yes. He's very nice, Mom. Please, can he stay with us?" Lily said.

Mom looked at End. He looked at Mom. He nodded.

"Hello, Mom. I'm End. I'm a talking swan. I'm Lily's friend. Can I stay with you?" End said.

Mom was speechless. She didn't know what to say. She looked at Lily and Ben. They looked at Mom. They smiled.

"Please, Mom. Please," they said.

Mom sighed. She smiled too.

"Okay, okay. You can stay with us, End. But only if you promise to be good and not make too much noise. And you have to share the bread with the other swans. Deal?" Mom said.

"Deal, Mom. Thank you, Mom. You're very nice, Mom," End said.

Lily, Ben, and End hugged Mom. They were happy. They had a new friend. A talking swan. His name was End. But his story was just beginning.

Ben and Mia like to play in the big room with many books and papers. They see a big box with a lock on it. They want to know what is inside. They look for a key, but they cannot find one. They see a metal thing that looks like a stick. It is a file. They think it can open the lock.

They take the file and try to put it in the lock. They push and pull, but nothing happens. They hear a loud noise. It is a beep. They look at the box. It has a red light and a number. The number is going down. 10, 9, 8...

They do not know what it means. They are scared. They tremble. They want to run away, but they do not know how. The door is locked too. They scream for help, but no one hears them. The number is going down. 3, 2, 1...

The box explodes. It makes a big fire and a big boom. It hurts Ben and Mia. They fall down and do not get up. The box was dangerous. It was a bomb. Someone put it there to hurt people. Ben and Mia did not know. They just wanted to play. They are gone. The end.

They pull and tug. The letter rips. They hear a loud noise. It is mom. She is coming.

They hide the letter under the couch. They pretend to play with their toys. Mom enters the room. She smiles.

"Hello, my sweeties. Did you have fun?" she asks.

"Yes, mom. We played nice," Lily says.

"Me too," Ben says.

Mom looks at the table. She sees the envelope. It is empty. She frowns.

"Where is my letter?" she asks.

Lily and Ben look at each other. They are scared. They do not know what to say.

Lily pokes Ben. She whispers in his ear.

"Tell her, tell her!" she says.

Ben pokes Lily back. He whispers in her ear.

"No, you tell her, you tell her!" he says.

Mom hears them. She bends down. She looks under the couch. She sees the letter. It is torn. She sighs.

"Who did this?" she asks.

They hug mom. They say together.

"We did, mom. We are sorry. We love you."

Mom hugs them back. She is not angry. She loves them too.

She says.

"It's okay, my sweeties. I forgive you. But next time, please be careful with my letters. They are important. They are from grandma. She misses us a lot."

"But we found them here," Ben says. "They are not yours."

"They are mine!" the man says. "I left them here for a while. They are very useful to me. The football is a gift for my son. The books are for my work. The toys and clothes are for charity. Now, give them back or I will call the police!"

Ben and Tom do not want to make the man more angry. They do not want to go to the police. They decide to give back the football and the box. They are sad. They liked the football.

"Sorry, mister," Tom says. "We did not know. Here is your football and your box."

"No, it is mine. You have your car," Lily said.

"But your tank is so cool. Please, let me have a turn," Tom begged.

"No, go away. You are annoying," Lily said.

Lily and Tom stopped yelling and looked at Mom. They felt scared and sorry.

"We were playing with the tank and the car and we had a fight," Lily said.

"We both wanted the tank and we broke it and we threw it and we hurt each other," Tom said.

Mom sighed and shook her head. She picked up the tank and the car and put them on the table. She took a cloth and wiped the tears and the dirt from Lily and Tom's faces.

"We are sorry, Mom. We are sorry, Lily. We are sorry, Tom," they said.

Lily and Tom were playing with their toys in the living room. They had a lot of fun making a big castle with blocks, cars, dolls and animals. They used glue to stick some parts together, so the castle would not fall down.

"Look, this is the king and the queen, and this is their baby princess," Lily said, showing Tom her dolls. "They live in the castle and they are very happy."

"That's nice, Lily," Tom said, nodding. "And this is the dragon, he is very big and strong. He protects the castle from bad guys. He can breathe fire and fly in the sky."

"Wow, Tom, your dragon is cool," Lily said, admiring his toy. "Can he be friends with the king and the queen?"

"Sure, he can," Tom said, smiling. "He is a good dragon, not a mean one. He likes the castle and the people in it."

They played for a while, making up stories and sounds for their toys. They were having a lot of fun, until they heard a loud noise from the kitchen.

"What was that?" Lily asked, scared.

"I don't know, let's go see," Tom said, curious.

They left their toys on the floor and ran to the kitchen. There they saw their big brother Sam, who had knocked over a jar of cookies and made a mess.

"Sam, what are you doing?" Lily asked, angry.

"I was hungry, and I wanted a cookie," Sam said, shrugging. "But the jar was too high, and I dropped it."

"You are so clumsy, Sam," Tom said, shaking his head. "You broke the jar and the cookies. Mom will be mad at you."

Sam looked at the broken jar and the crumbs on the floor. He felt bad and sorry. He didn't mean to make a mess. He wished he could fix it.

"Maybe we can help you, Sam," Lily said, kindly. "We have glue, we can glue the jar back together."

"Really? You would do that for me?" Sam asked, surprised.

"Sure, we would," Tom said, nodding. "You are our brother, and we love you. And glue is important, it can fix things."

They ran back to the living room and got the glue. They carefully glued the pieces of the jar together, and put the cookies back inside. They were very proud of their work.

"Thank you, Lily and Tom," Sam said, hugging them. "You are the best. You saved me from trouble."

"You're welcome, Sam," Lily and Tom said, smiling. "But next time, ask mom for a cookie, okay?"

"Okay, I will," Sam said, nodding. "And next time, can I play with you and your castle?"

"Okay, you can," Lily and Tom said, nodding. "But you have to be careful, and not break anything."

"Okay, I will," Sam said, nodding. "And I will protect the castle with you and your dragon."

But on the way, they saw a cat. The cat was on the road. It looked scared and hurt. It had a cut on its leg. Lily and Tom felt sorry for the cat. They wanted to help it.

"Mom, can we stop and help the cat?" Lily asked.

"Of course, dear. We can delay going to the park for a little while. The cat needs our help. You are very compassionate, Lily and Tom," Mom said.

Mom parked the car and got out. She took a blanket and a bottle of water from the trunk. She gently wrapped the cat in the blanket and gave it some water. The cat purred and licked Mom's hand.

"Thank you, Mom. You are very kind," the cat seemed to say.

Lily and Tom smiled. They were glad the cat was feeling better. They petted the cat and talked to it softly.

"Can we take the cat home, Mom?" Tom asked.

"Well, we have to find out if the cat has a home already. Maybe it has a collar or a tag with its name and address. If not, we can take it to the vet and see if they can find its owner. If no one claims the cat, then maybe we can adopt it. How does that sound?" Mom asked.

Lily and Tom nodded. They liked that idea. They hoped the cat would be their new friend.

They got back in the car and drove to the vet. They did not mind delaying going to the park. They had found a better way to spend their day. They had shown compassion to a cat in need. And they had learned a valuable lesson. Sometimes, helping others is more fun than playing.

"Of course, my dear. You can invite whoever you want. It's your special day," his mom said.

"Can I invite Aunt Lucy too?" he said.

"Tommy, I don't think Aunt Lucy would enjoy your party. She doesn't like fun things. She likes to sit and complain. She might make you and your friends unhappy," his mom said.

"OK, Sam, but be careful!" Mia said. "The hill is steep and bumpy."

They pedaled hard and reached the top of the hill. They saw a pond with ducks and a bridge. They also saw a sign that said "No bikes allowed".

"Wow, this is pretty!" Mia said. "But we can't go on the bridge with our bikes. What should we do?"

"Let's settle our bikes here and walk across the bridge," Sam said. "We can come back for them later."

They got off their bikes and left them by the sign. They took off their helmets and held them in their hands. They walked across the bridge and fed the ducks some bread. They had fun watching the ducks swim and quack.

"Let's take some butter," Tim says. "Mom won't know."

"OK," Kim says. "But how do we get it?"

"Tim and Kim, what are you doing?" she asks.

They look at Mom. They see her angry face. They feel bad.

"We are sorry, Mom," they say. "We took some butter. We were hungry."

Mom sighs. She knows they like butter. But she also knows they should not steal.

"Tim and Kim, stealing is wrong," she says. "You should ask me first. And you should not put butter in your pocket. It will make a mess."

She shows them their pockets. They are full of melted butter. It drips on the floor.

They see their pockets. They are shocked. They did not think of that.

"Oops," they say.

Mom shakes her head. She makes them clean their pockets and the floor. She also makes them share the rest of the butter with their brother and sister.

"Like what?" Ben asked.

"Like this!" Lila said. She picked up an orange from her bag and threw it at the snowman.

"Hey, don't do that!" Ben said. "That's not nice. That's my orange. I was going to eat it."

But it was too late. The orange hit the snowman and broke into pieces. The pieces fell on the snow and made it look dirty.

"Oops," Lila said. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make a mess. I just wanted to make him more colorful."

"Well, you didn't," Ben said. "You made him worse. And you wasted my orange. That was not a good thing to do."

Lila felt bad. She realized she had been selfish and rude. She wanted to make it up to Ben.

"I'm sorry, Ben," she said. "I was wrong. I should have asked you first. And I should have been more careful. Can you forgive me?"

Ben looked at Lila. He saw that she was sincere and sorry. He decided to be kind and forgiving.

"It's OK, Lila," he said. "I forgive you. But next time, please think before you act. And don't throw things at people or things. That can hurt them or ruin them."
